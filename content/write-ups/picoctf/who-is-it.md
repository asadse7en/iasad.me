## Description

Someone just sent you an email claiming to be Google's co-founder Larry Page but you suspect a scam.Can you help us identify whose mail server the email actually originated from?Download the email fileÂ [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/499/email-export.eml). Flag: picoCTF{FirstnameLastname}

## Approach

we need to find the IP address of the sender. In order to determine the sender's IP address, we should search for it within the provided `.eml` file.

we can perform a {{< url link="https://www.whois.com/whois/" text="WHOIS" >}} lookup using the IP address 173.249.33.206 to retrieve the owner's name.
