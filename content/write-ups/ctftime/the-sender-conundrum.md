## Description

Marcus Got a Mysterious mail promising a flag if he could crack the password to the file.****

**Download Attachments: TheEmail.eml  unzipme.zip**

## Approach

we were given two files **unzipme.zip** that require password and an **TheEmail.eml** which include a hint for the zip password in the form of a riddle

```bash
<p></p>Hello Marcus Cooper,<br>
 You are one step behind from finding your flag. <br>
 Here is a Riddle: <br>
 I am a noun and not a verb or an adverb.<br>
 I am given to you at birth and never taken away,<br>
 You keep me until you die, come what may.<br>
 What am I?<br>
```

My guessing was it is either ( name, soul, spirit, identity, breath, life ) or a name of person. I tried all these but nothing worked. I even tried to brute force it with ****top_1000_usa_malenames_english.txt**** which is well known for username enumeration but no success.

then i tried to bruteforce it with **rockyou.txt** and it worked.

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøiasad)-[~/CTFs/VishwaCTF]
‚îî‚îÄ$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
BrandonLee       (unzipme.zip/unzipme/flag.txt)     
1g 0:00:00:02 DONE (2023-04-02 09:08) 0.3921g/s 4452Kp/s 4452Kc/s 4452KC/s
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

The flag was in plaintext after unzipping the "unzipme.zip" file using the password ‚ÄúBrandonLee‚Äù

## My Thoughts

I feel somewhat let down by this challenge because the riddle hinted that the password might be a name, which turned out to be true. However, the password wasn't found in any of the popular name wordlists, such as **top_1000_usa_malenames_english.txt [üîó](https://github.com/x-o-r-r-o/Cracking/blob/master/top_1000_usa_malenames_english.txt)** or **names.txt [üîó](https://github.com/huntergregal/wordlists/blob/master/names.txt)** which I attempted to brute-force using the John, with no success. Frankly, it never occurred to me to use the **rockyou.txt** list for brute-forcing a name. this took up a lot of time üòø
