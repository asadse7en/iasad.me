## Approach

we are given a `.schematic` file and we have to count the number of dispensers used.

> A schematic is a type of file format used to represent a 3D object or structure in Minecraft, It contains a blueprint or schematic of a Minecraft build.

Tools such as **MCEdit** and **WorldEdit** can be used to analyze `.schematic` files, and there are also several online sites that offer the same functionality.

I oped the file in {{< url link="https://cubical.xyz/" text="cubical.xyz" >}} but I had to manually count the dispensers, So I looked for alternatives and discovered {{< url link="https://www.mineprints.net/" text="Mineprints" >}} which conveniently displayed the number of dispensers used in the schematic.
