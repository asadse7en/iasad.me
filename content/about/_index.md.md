## **Hi There👋**
My name is Asad Ullah 👨‍💻, a final-year **CS** undergraduate🎓 from **Swat, Pakistan 🇵🇰**. I'm passionate about cybersecurity🛡️ and enjoy participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) events.

💪 My ultimate career goal is to become a 💻 penetration tester, and I'm actively seeking cybersecurity **internships** to further enhance my skills. I love 🎯 focusing on honing my abilities on platforms such as [**ctftime**](https://ctftime.org/user/149593/ "My CTF Profile") and [**tryhackme**](https://tryhackme.com/p/asadse7en/ "150 streak - April 2023") and plan to pursue my **OSCP certification**  in the near future, Insha'Allah.

I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity 🔒, and I look forward to contributing my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact.
