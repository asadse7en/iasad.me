[{"content":"Introduction We will be tackling a hacking challenge today on tryhackme, where the community have created multiple challenges. you can participate in these challenges freely.\nSpecifically, I will be providing a walkthrough on the crack the hash challenge. This challenge comprises nine tasks, which I will explain in detail, one by one.\nTools used for hash analyzing and cracking hashes hash-identifier hash-analyzer hash-identification hashcat crackstation hashes Task 1 - md5 hash: 48bb6e862e54f2a795ffc4e541caed4d\nFirst we need to identify the hash type using tools like hash-identifier or online hash analyzer sites like hash-analyzer\nso it is an MD5 hash now to crack it we can use tools like hashcat or online platform like crackstation\nAnswer: easy\nTask 2 - sha1 hash: CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97\nsimilarly we can find this one also on crackstation. this time it is a sha1 hash\nAnswer: password123\nTask 3 - sha256 hash: 1C8BFE8F801D79745C4631D09FFF36C82AA37FC4CCE4FC946683D7B336B63032\nagain we will use crackstation. this time it is a sha256 hash\nAnswer: letmein\nTask 4 - bcrypt hash: $2y$12$Dwt1BZj6pcyc3Dy1FWZ5ieeUznr71EeNkJkUlypTsgbX1H68wsRom\nAnalyzing hash type using hash-analyzer we can see it is a bcrypt hash\nThis hash is difficult to crack using online tools, which is why we can use tools such as hashcat\nHashcat Hashcat is a password cracking tool that uses brute-force, dictionary, and rule-based attacks to recover passwords from various types of hashed data.\nto install hashcat → sudo apt install hashcat. to crack hashes using hashcat we provide it the hashhashed.txt a wordlist i.e. rockyou.txt and -m switch for mode (mode specify hash type)for bcrypt mode is -m 3200\nAsad@Kali:~/tools/hashcat$ ./hashcat64.bin -m 3200 hash.txt ../rockyou.txt Answer: bleh\nTask 5 - md4 Hash: 279412f945939ba78ce0758d3fd83daa\nagain the same process identify the hash using hash-analyzer and crack it using hashcat\n./hashcat64.bin -m 900 hash.txt rockyou.txt\nthis one was also present on crackstation\nAnswer: Ethernity22\nTask 6 - sha256 hash: F09EDCB1FCEFC6DFB23DC3505A882655FF77375ED8AA2D1C13F640FCCC2D0C85\nsame drill - identify hash type → hash-analyzer\nHashcat asad@kali:~/tools/hashcat$ ./hashcat64.bin -m 1400 hash.txt ../rockyou.txt hashcat (v5.1.0) starting... * Device #1: WARNING!

Exciting news for the cybersecurity world! They\u0026rsquo;ve even added a special edition called Kali Purple, specifically designed for those on the defense side of cybersecurity. This version is perfect for Blue and Purple team members who want to strengthen their security strategies.\nKali Linux is a go-to choice for ethical hackers and security experts who want to test network systems for vulnerabilities and conduct cybersecurity research. With Python updates and other new features, this latest release promises to make cybersecurity even more accessible and effective.\nKali Purple - The dawn of a new era. Kali is not only Offense, but starting to be defense Python Changes - Python 3.11 \u0026amp; PIP changes going forward 2023 Theme - Our once a year theme update! This time, what’s old is new again Desktop Updates - Xfce 4.18 \u0026amp; KDE Plasma 5.27 Default Kernel Settings - What makes the Kali kernel different New Tools - As always, various new tools added Kali Purple at Kali Linux 2023.1 Kali Purple is a new addition to Kali Linux 2023.1, designed for defensive security. It is specifically aimed at Blue and Purple team members, providing a comprehensive suite of tools for security professionals specializing in penetration testing and ethical hacking.\nWhat is in Kali Purple? Kali Purple is a reference architecture for the ultimate SOC In-A-Box It is perfect for learning, practicing SOC analysis and threat hunting, security control design and testing, Blue/Red/Purple teaming exercises, Kali spy vs. spy competitions, and protecting small to medium-sized environments It has over 100 defensive tools, including Arkime, CyberChef, Elastic Security, GVM, TheHive, Malcolm, Suricata, Zeek, and all the usual Kali tools It also has defensive tool documentation, a pre-generated image, and Kali Autopilot, an attack script builder/framework for automated attacks Kali Purple Hub is available for the community to share practice pcaps, Kali Autopilot scripts for blue teaming exercises, and community Wiki It has a defensive menu structure according to NIST CSF Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover Kali Purple Discord channels for community collaboration and fun It has a unique theme with installer, menu entries, and Xfce. Python Updates \u0026amp; Changes Debian is getting ready to release its next stable version, which means packages are being updated. Python is one such package, with Python 3.11 now available in Debian. This new version brings more informative error tracebacks and a significant speed increase. However, some older packages may not be supported with the upgrade.\nOne change that may catch people off guard is Python\u0026rsquo;s PIP behavior. Using PIP to install Python modules can clash with the operating system\u0026rsquo;s package management system, apt. To avoid this issue, users have three options:\nUse apt install python3-\u0026lt;package\u0026gt; (easy, simple \u0026amp; recommended) Use venv (slightly more complicated but still recommended) Use -break-system-packages (warning warning warning!) Kali Linux has applied a temporary patch to give users more time to adjust their procedures. However, this patch will be dropped with the release of Kali 2023.4 in the fourth quarter of this year. After that, PIP will refuse to install packages system-wide, and users will need to use one of the recommended options mentioned earlier. Kali Linux will remind users of this change with each version building up to the release. It is important to update scripts, pipelines, and documentation to the recommended ways to avoid issues with the new Python update.\nTheme Refresh Kali Linux 2023.1 has a brand new theme with updated wallpapers for the desktop, login, and boot displays. The Kali purple flavor is also included, and all desktops are now supported with new purple themes and icons. This year, in celebration of the 10-year anniversary, the theme is inspired by previous iconic Kali releases.\nthe backgrounds pays tribute to previous iconic Kali releases:\nBoot - Kali 1.0 Login/Lock - Kali 2.0 Wallpaper - Kali 1.1 Check out the latest Kali screenshot alongside the reference images below.\nBoot menu: Login/Lock:\nDesktop:\nAll new wallpapers New Tools in Kali It would not be a Kali release if there were not any new tools added! A quick run down of what has been added (to the network repositories):\nArkime CyberChef DefectDojo Dscan Kubernetes-Helm PACK2 Redeye Unicrypto There have also been numerous packages updates and new libraries as well. We also bump the Kali kernel to 6.1!\nDownload Kali Linux 2023.1 Kali Linux 2023.1 can be downloaded or you can update your existing installation to this version.\nMy Thoughts Kali Linux 2023.1 has made a great impression on me! What I really like is Kali Purple, a special edition designed for defensive security. Kali Purple comes with more than 100 tools that are perfect for practicing SOC analysis and threat hunting, as well as other things. This release also has some updates to Python and other elements that make it even better. The new theme is a nice touch and pays tribute to previous Kali versions that are well-known. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m extremely happy with Kali Linux 2023.1\n","permalink":"https://iasad.me/blogs/kali-linux-2023-1/","summary":"A comprehensive overview of the latest version of Kali, covering its features, enhancements, and upgrades, to provide you with all the necessary knowledge about this version.","title":"Kali Linux 2023.1: The Ultimate Platform for Offensive and Defensive Security"}]
