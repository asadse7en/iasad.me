# Portfolio Website
This is the source code for my website. I use this website to write CTF [writeups](https://iasad.me/write-ups), [notes](https://notes.iasad.me), and [blogs](https://iasad.me/blogs) on topics that interest me. I also use this website to host my [resume](https://iasad.me/resume).
## Credits
* I am using [Papermod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme with some tweaks.
* Color scheme is inspired by the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color palette.
* I am using [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) font.

### I made some modifications to the theme which you can find here [here](https://github.com/asadse7en/PaperMod-Tweaks)
